# AANMF

Adaptive Affinity Learning NMF

Code in Matlab for the paper "Adaptive Affinity Learning for Accurate Community Detection (ICDM 2018)" [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8594997)]. The implementation has invoked the algorithms proposed in "A non-monotonic method for large-scale non-negative least squares", "Efficient projections onto the l1-ball for learning in high dimensions" and "A feasible method for optimization with orthogonality constraints".
